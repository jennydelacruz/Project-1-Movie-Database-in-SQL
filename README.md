# Movie Database in SQL
In this project, I investigated a Relational Database, using PostgreSQL, as part of Udacity's Nanodegree "Programming for Data Science". This project was submitted to a Udacity reviewer, and was checked against specific requirements to pass the programme. 

This project allowed me to practice the data analysis process; starting by asking relevant questions, running appropriate SQL queries and finishing by sharing my findings through visualizations desgined in MS Power Point. SQL was used to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answered some key questions about the database. 

The Queries specifications to be met were: 
1) All SQL queries run without errors and produce the intended results.
2) Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit JOINs. The JOIN or JOINs should be necessary to the query.
3) Each SQL query needs to include one or more aggregations. This could be a COUNT, AVG, SUM, or other aggregation
4) At least 2 of the 4 SQL queries need to include either a subquery OR a CTE.
5) At least 1 of the 4 queries should use a Window Function.
6) The SQL queries are well formatted and use aliases.

While the Visualizations specifications were:
1) Each slide should have a question and an appropriate visualization descriptions to address the question. 
2) All visualizations should make logical sense and provide accurate analysis based on their query results.
3) All visualizations include a title and axis labels, have a legend where applicable, and are easily understood.
