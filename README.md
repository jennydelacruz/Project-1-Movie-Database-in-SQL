# SQL-project1
In this project, I investigated a Relational Database, using PostgreSQL, as part of Udacity's Nanodegree "Programming for Data Science". This project was submitted to a Udacity reviewer, and was checked against specific requirements to pass the programme. 

This project allowed me to practice the data analysis process; starting by asking relevant questions, running appropriate SQL queries and finishing by sharing my findings through visualizations desgined in MS Power Point. SQL was used to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answered some key questions about the database. 

The Database contained 15 tables:
actor – stores actors data including first name and last name.
film – stores film data such as title, release year, length, rating, etc.
film_actor – stores the relationships between films and actors.
category – stores film’s categories data.
film_category- stores the relationships between films and categories.
store – contains the store data including manager staff and address.
inventory – stores inventory data.
rental – stores rental data.
payment – stores customer’s payments.
staff – stores staff data.
customer – stores customer data.
address – stores address data for staff and customers
city – stores city names.
country – stores country names.
